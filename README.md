# ARADI and LLAMA implementations (2024)

Implementation of the NSA cryptography algorithm [ARADI and LLAMA](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1240), published on 2024-08-05.

To do update on 29/08/2024:
- Organize the repo folder and issue structure
- Organize the python code in order to make the call via CMD easier
- Implement LLAMA
- Create pip package to encrypt and decrypt using ARADI
- Start optimizing the python code and implementing it in other languages (C, for example)
- Create unit tests/module for testing inputs and outputs to verify the integrity of the encryption
- Organize the port to other systems and benchmark speed.
